      <p>“Haha, mother,” he yelled at Charlene and humiliated Ryuku. “Not to mention his affair with Hanako Love.” Charlene briefly listened to the conversation Natsumi was having with their mother. Natsumi was still attempting to sway their mother’s decision to renounce their attendance at the ceremony. Their mother ignored Natsumi and allowed the plump tailoress to adjust her kimono in front of the living room’s mirror.</p>

      <p>Charlene scaled her fingers faster down the sapphire grand piano; she didn’t bother to give her opinion—Natsumi didn’t comprehend that their family was attending the ceremony out of honor. Her adoptive father, Takahiro, was once a good friend to Kazuhiko’s father before he had died. Takahiro had arranged this ceremony to bring good publicity to the Wakahisa family to aid an old friend’s son in reestablishing his business after nearly destroying it. Out of respect for her adoptive father she would attend the ceremony without complaint—even if she did feel a little anger towards the arrogant tea host.</p>

      <p>Charlene passionately played a soft piece from Charlie Red Bones, as thoughts of Kazuhiko muddled her mind. He had seemed so upset for no real reason—why had her opinion of him affected her so? Perhaps he was truly just arrogant and she was reading more into last night’s encounter than she should be. Smiling to herself, she allowed the soul of music to progress her spirit down the piano keys, never noticing the keys’ weight as she did so. Music was her life. Charlene was a musical protégé with a repertoire that varied from Beethoven, Rachmaninoff, James C. Peterson, Duke Ellington, Gershwin, Scott Joplin to William Grant Still. She started playing piano in the orphanage in Harlem but hadn’t begun her first real music lesson until the Kochiyamas had adopted her. Over years of formal instruction she had learned over twenty instruments, composed for each, and even conducted orchestras—though Jazz remained her first love and the piano its soul’s truest voice.</p>

      <p>The elder tailor attempted to correct her sister’s kimono but was thwarted as Natsumi continued her argument.</p>

      <p>“I don’t see any benefit in attending a ceremony hosted by that womanizer,” Natsumi said, running towards their mother’s side.</p>

      <p>“What will people think of us associating with him?” she added, grasping her mother’s shoulder. The tailor again tried to arrange Natsumi’s kimono, but as their mother moved from the dining table to sip her wine, Natsumi followed—causing the tailor to lose her place.</p>

      <p>Her adoptive mother, Sachiko, placed the wine glass on the wooden table. Smoothing her hair, she checked herself in the ornamental oversized mirrors. “Natsumi, please—we are attending the ceremony for Kazuhiko’s sake, per your father’s request.” Her mother chided.</p>
